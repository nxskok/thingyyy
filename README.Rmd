# thingyyy

Two random functions, testing my ability to make a package.

## Installation

You can install thingyyy from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nxskok/thingyyy")
```

## Example

There are two functions.

The first one adds one to anything you feed it, if it can:

```{r, error=T}
library("thingyyy")
add_one(3)
add_one(c(2,4))
add_one("x")
```

The second one takes a data frame with a quantitative column `x`, a categorical column `g`, and something else that will say what goes in which row, and spreads it into wide format:

```{r}
dd = tibble::tribble(
~r, ~x, ~g,
1, 10, "a",
2, 12, "a",
3, 14, "a",
1, 15, "b",
2, 17, "b",
3, 19, "b"
)
dd
my_spread(dd)
```
